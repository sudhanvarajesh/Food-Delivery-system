# Food-Delivery-system

The project is that of a food order and delivery system where functionality is provided for the user to select items from a menu that is available, and place an order. The project also allows a restaurant owner to manage items in their menu and manage details of the labour (delivery boys) hired by the restaurant owner. The project uses swing for the UI and Postgres as the database.
